On Wednesday 20th, we made magic at FredCon'24 <i class="emoji" style="background-image:url('//telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09FA799E2808DE29982.png')"><b>🧙‍♂️</b></i>. More than a hundred people came to Google Campus to listen to HR representatives talking about best practices and how to take care of talent. You can see a bunch of pictures people made at the conference here: <a href="https://mnfrd.co/40X2QMb" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://mnfrd.co/40X2QMb</a>. And you can find many posts with <a href="?q=%23fredcon24">#fredcon24</a> on LinkedIn. Soon you could see all the conference videos. <br>Let's change HR and recruiting for better! <i class="emoji" style="background-image:url('//telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09FA5B0.png')"><b>🥰</b></i>
