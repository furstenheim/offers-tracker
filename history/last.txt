Saturday vibes! Today we want to share with you a whole Manfred Day <i class="emoji" style="background-image:url('//telegram.org/img/emoji/40/E29382.png')"><b>Ⓜ️</b></i>! Only Manfred offers managed by us.<br>Just as a reminder, we keep fighting <i class="emoji" style="background-image:url('//telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09F92AA.png')"><b>💪</b></i> against bad offers and misinformation, making offers stunning with the things you need to know when thinking about a job change, such as technical challenge, the team, stack, organization, or process steps.<br>Remember, every time you apply to a Manfred offer, a Fredder (a Manfred scout) will check your experience/background and will give you an answer with feedback. Always. Whether it could be a YES or a NO. It can take time if we have a lot of applications, but you will receive an answer always.<br>This is not about numbers or salaries or fit. It's about people. Thanks for keeping supporting this channel <i class="emoji" style="background-image:url('//telegram.org/img/emoji/40/F09F9299.png')"><b>💙</b></i>
